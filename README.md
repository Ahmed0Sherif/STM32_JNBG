# STM32_JNBG
This repository includes the schematics and PCB design of a double-layer STM32 development Board. It contains STM32F030F4P6 ARM Cortex M0 controller. This design includes a USB interface using a CH4340C.
The code name "JNBG" is in the honour of my group who helped and encouraged me in this project.
The design is done on KiCAD 6.0
