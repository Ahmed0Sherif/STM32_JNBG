# Intro
- This repository includes the schematics and PCB design of a double-layer STM32 development Board.
- The code name "JNBG" is in the honour of my group who helped and encouraged me in this project.
- The design is done on KiCAD 6.0

# SchematicS:
## A-Power Module:

<br> - In this circuit, the AMS1117 is used to regulate 5V from USB to 3.3V, with a unidirectional TVS to protect against surges.

## B-USB Interface:

<br> - The board is provided with a USB-B Micro port, providing power and communication to the controller. 
<br> - The differential pair is connected to au nidirectional Dual TVS for ESD protection. Finally, the differentials are connected to a USB-to-TTL interface: CH340C. This variant was chosen because it can operate without an external crystal.
<br> - It is worth mentioning that until this time, this module has not been tested yet.

## C-Main Controller:

### a- Crystal Oscillator
- For calculting the value of capacitors, the following equation is used:
<br>   Capacitor Value =  ( Load Capaitance of Crystal [10pf] + Stray Capacitance of PCB [maximum estimate = 10pF] ) / 2
- Source: Phill's Lab Course on KiCAD 6.0
### b- Power:
- According to the datasheet of STM32f03x, it is recommeded to connect VDD pin to the shown capacitances.
- For more stable ADC performance, a ferrite bead is added to the VDDA connections.
### c- Interfacing:
- GPIO pins are connected to headers for easier interface, while taking speical signals into considerations (i.e. I2C pair)
- A SPDT switch is added to control the BOOT0 pin, and a RST button is added.
- For experimental purposes, extra pair of headers are added to power the STM32 directly, bypassing the regulator.
